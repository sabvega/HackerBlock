		So my first hackathon ever was Hackmit.
		</p>
		<p>
		I had just graduated from high school and applied to everything and anything with the hopes of getting accepted into at least one hackathon or internship. The day I found out my team got in to HackMit, I was ecstatic! I had no idea what we were going to do other than the fact that we would <i>definitely</i>  be going and that it would be a great experience for all us. The day of HackMit soon came and that meant it was time to get hacking. Hacking what? Well that was still pending. It was still pending when it was officially announced that HackMihad started. Everyone looked like they knew what they were doing, whether it be a software or hardware hack. Fortunately, we came up with an idea after brainstorming. Unfortunately, 4 hours into the hack we began to get the feeling that it would take more than 24 hours in order to finish the hack.

		So what did we do?
